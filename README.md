This repository is meant for a course (Blok Tech) of my study, Communication & Multimedia Design on the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. <br>
In this repo I'll list and commit my projects and my classes, and will keep them up to date.

I will also put the research and study I did in my wiki, you'll be able to keep track of everything I did and used for this course.

--------------------------------------------

## The Assignment

For this course, we need to design and create a Matching Application and this application can be all sorts of matching.

For instance, matching:
* People with people
* People with things
* People with animals
* People with places
* Animals with animals

Etc.

### The Application (summary)

I have chosen to make an matching application for people, matching them with new music.

Users of this app can, when making their account, select the music that they are already fan off, listening to, or preference to certain genres. <br>
Then, the app will show them recommended music, based on similar artist, songs, or popular tracks that others are fan off. <br>
Users get to like, dislike (not for me), or super like a song, and will be able to immediately add the song to their music library of choice. <br>
Songs that they like will also be saved in a Liked Songs library on the app itself, so the user can keep track of their liked songs and easily find them again if needed.

In the app, you can connect with your friends (whome also use the app), and you can get matched sooner with songs that your friends have also liked (as in, if one or more of your friends like a song, that song will appear quicker on your homescreen to match with, then songs based of the music library from for example Spotify, Apple Music or the In-App Music Library).

## Using my application

To use my application, you first need a couple of things:

- Basic knowledge about JavaScript, Node and NPM
- A code editor (VS Code, Atom, Brackets, etc)
- Node
- NPM

### Installation

1. First of all, download the code (click on the code button (green), and choose to download the code as a ZIP file).
2. Unzip the file and open it in your code editor.
3. Open the ternimal of that editor, and run the command `npm start` , this will run the server.
4. Open your web browser, and navigate to the localhost port that is given ( `localhost:3000` ).
5. Enjoy my application!

Alternativaly you can fork the code
