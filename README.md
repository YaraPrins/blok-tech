# Welcome to my Blok-Tech Repository

This repository is meant for a course (Blok Tech) of my study, Communication & Multimedia Design on the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. <br>
In this repo I'll list and commit my projects and my classes, and will keep them up to date.

I will also put the research and study I did in my wiki, you'll be able to keep track of everything I did and used for this course.

This course is devided into two parts:

The first 5 weeks we need to work individually on a assignment, one for each of the classes.<br>
This individual assignments are in correlation with each other, and will also be correlating with the second part of the course. <br>
In the last 3 weeks of the course, we will be working in a team, combining parts of the previous weeks together.

--------------------------------------------

## The classes
The classes I'm currently following are:

* Project Tech
* Back-End Development
* Front-End Development 2

--------------------------------------------

## The Assignment

For this course, we need to design and create a Matching Application and this application can be all sorts of matching.

For instance, matching:
* People with people
* People with things
* People with animals
* People with places
* Animals with animals

Etc.

I have chosen to make an matching application for people, matching them with new music.

Users of this app can, when making their account, select the music that they are already fan off, listening to, or preference to certain genres. <br>
Then, the app will show them recommended music, based on similar artist, songs, or popular tracks that others are fan off. <br>
Users get to like, dislike (not for me), or super like a song, and will be able to immediately add the song to their music library of choice. <br>
Songs that they like will also be saved in a Liked Songs library on the app itself, so the user can keep track of their liked songs and easily find them again if needed.

In the app, you can connect with your friends (whome also use the app), and you can get matched sooner with songs that your friends have also liked (as in, if one or more of your friends like a song, that song will appear quicker on your homescreen to match with, then songs based of the music library from for example Spotify, Apple Music or the In-App Music Library).


--------------------------------------------

## Using my application

To use my application, you first need a couple of things:

- A code editor (VS Code, Atom, Brackets, etc)
- Node
- NPM

### Installation

1. First of all, you need to download my code by clicking on the code button (green), and choose to download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Unzip the file and open it in your code editor
3. Open the ternimal of that editor, and run the command `npm start` , this will run the server
4. Open your web browser, and navigate to the localhost port that is given ( `localhost:3000` )
5. Enjoy my application!

## About the classes

### Project Tech

In the first few weeks of Project Tech, we will be making a single feature for this Matching Application. We will sketch, design and build this feature and will incorporate it somewhere later on in this course. <br>

### Back-End Development

For this class, we will be focussing on the _server-side_ part of Web Development. We will work with Node.JS, MongoDB and HTTP.

### Front-End Development (2)

In this class, we will be focussing on the _client-side_ part of Web Development, but specifically focused on ES6 JavaScript.
